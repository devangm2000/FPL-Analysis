	<h3>Analysis:</h3>
	<br>
	<p>The above visualization depicts the amount of players playing in the different positions in a football field across all 
	the teams in the league.<br>It shows us that there are only a selected few players that play in the wide and forward positions as compared to the defending positions, which shows us that there is much more of <br>choice to users in that part of the team while selecting it so they have to be more careful.</p>
